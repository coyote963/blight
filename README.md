Stands for Boring Light

Still a work in progress

Work that still needs to get done:
 - User profile page redirect after login
 - Tournament pages (Integration with Challonge API)
 - Hook up to APIs that rent servers
 - Direct Messages

On the backend side:
 - Create a database storing server reservations
 - Create endpoints for proxying server requests
 - Endpoints for checking server statuses
 - Tokens authorization
